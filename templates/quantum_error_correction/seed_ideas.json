    "Experiment": "Investigate the introduction of new symmetry operations in rotated surface codes to enhance their error-correcting capabilities. By identifying additional symmetrical properties within the code lattice, we can redesign the code to be more robust against specific error types. Develop theoretical models incorporating these new symmetries and implement them in simulations to evaluate their impact on logical error rates and decoding efficiency compared to standard rotated surface codes.",

  "Experiment": "Develop a subsystem version of the rotated surface code by introducing gauge qubits and converting certain stabilizers into gauge operators. This approach aims to reduce the total number of physical qubits required for the code by allowing for more flexibility in measurement and error correction. Evaluate the performance of the subsystem rotated surface code through simulations, comparing its error correction capabilities and resource requirements to those of the conventional rotated surface code.",
