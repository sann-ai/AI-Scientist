    "Experiment": "Investigate the incorporation of twist defects into rotated surface codes to create novel topological structures. Twist defects can host Majorana zero modes and allow for the encoding of logical qubits in a more efficient manner. Develop protocols for creating and manipulating twist defects within the lattice of a rotated surface code. Perform simulations to evaluate the error correction performance and stability of these codes under various noise models, comparing the results with standard rotated surface codes.",

    "Experiment": "Investigate the introduction of new symmetry operations in rotated surface codes to enhance their error-correcting capabilities. By identifying additional symmetrical properties within the code lattice, we can redesign the code to be more robust against specific error types. Develop theoretical models incorporating these new symmetries and implement them in simulations to evaluate their impact on logical error rates and decoding efficiency compared to standard rotated surface codes.",
